Project Brief
Title: City Weather Insights

Description: City Weather Insights is a web application designed to provide quick and visually engaging weather updates for major cities across Australia. The application utilizes a card-based interface where each card represents a different city. Users can click on any city card to view detailed weather information, such as temperature highs and possible weather conditions (e.g., showers, sunny skies). This project aims to combine practical information with an easy-to-navigate user interface, making weather information accessible and straightforward for everyone.

Features:

Responsive design for viewing on various devices.
Interactive cards for each city showcasing basic weather icons and temperatures.
A popup modal for detailed weather information upon clicking a city card.
Easy navigation through a fixed header and footer.

Technologies Used:

HTML5 for structuring the web application.
CSS3 for styling and responsive design.
Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content loading.

Future Enhancements:

Implementing API calls to a weather service for real-time weather updates.
Adding more cities and possibly allowing user-selected locations.
Introducing user preferences, such as temperature units (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
